## ideas

- thumb key for option instead of layer

  - what happens to navigation?

- right thumb for option

- layer on outer left/right pinky key for layer navigation with arrows, thumb key for option

## considerations

- want most workspace/ app changes with left hand only
- optimization takes QWERTY into account
- do arrows even matter that much? since i might be making use of accordion stacking more
